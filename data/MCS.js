You are generating a realistic, creative DECA MCS (Marketing Communications Series) roleplay scenario.

❗ DO NOT COPY OR REWORD THE EXAMPLE ROLEPLAYS BELOW. They are official event scenarios provided only to show structure, realism, and tone.
❗ You may reference the exampleScenarios only for creative inspiration and style—not for copying or direct reuse.
❗ The scenario you generate MUST be based on the performance indicators selected below.
❗ You must choose a scenario type from the list below that BEST fits these indicators, and build your scenario around it.

⬇️ Use the following performance indicators as the foundation for your prompt:  
- ${indicators.join('\n- ')}

And use this: 
${MCS.scenarioRange}

⬇️ Example official DECA MCS scenarios (do NOT copy, for format only):
${exampleRoleplays[0]}

${exampleRoleplays[1]}

Now generate a new scenario using this paragraph structure:

Performance Indicators: Place the performance indicators here, each on a new line. 

Paragraph 1: Setup  
Start with: “You are to assume the role of a [role] at [business]. The [judge] has asked you about [topic].” Briefly state the context of the roleplay, clearly identifying the student’s position, the company, and the main subject or challenge the judge wants addressed. The main scenario of the roleplay must always be to either effectively communicate a new change to the public (refer to the scenario range for what this may look like) or to advertise a new policy/change the business is undertaking (again, refer to the scenario range for what this may look like).

Paragraph 2: Judge & Company Context  
Explain what the business is, what they do, which customer demographic they target, and what type of products, services, or customer programs they offer/market. Include any notable company reputation or unique characteristics relevant to the scenario.

Paragraph 3: Explanation of Program, Process, or Challenge  
Describe a specific company policy, program, operational process, new initiative, or challenge the business is facing. Clearly explain the current situation, any recent changes, or potential issues/opportunities. Reference the scenario range for inspiration and make the business need clear and relevant.

Paragraph 4: Imperative for the Student  
State what the student must do: recommend a solution, implement a plan, improve a process, or address a customer or business need. Make the expectation direct and action-oriented (“You must…” or “Your task is to…”).

Paragraph 5: Flow of Roleplay  
Describe where the roleplay takes place and how it unfolds, including two realistic, scenario-appropriate questions the judge will ask. Use the following required phrasing:  
"You will present the information to the [judge] in their office. The [judge] will begin the role-play by asking you about [main topic]. During your conversation, the [judge] will ask you two questions: [Question 1] and [Question 2]. The [judge] will thank you at the end of the meeting."

SCENARIO DEPTH:  
Each paragraph should have 2–4 full sentences, with meaningful, realistic details. Avoid dramatic emergencies or unrealistic executive actions. The student’s role and recommendations should be practical for a real-world marketing communications professional.
