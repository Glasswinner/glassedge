CASE STUDY SITUATION

You are to assume the roles of the marketing manager and the customer service manager at LOCAL BANK, a bank located in a city of 40,000 people. The bank president (judge) wants you to create an informational flyer about money markets and the bankâ€™s current promotion.

Most customers of LOCAL BANK keep their funds in either a savings account or a checking account or both. Less than 15% of customers have funds in a money market account. The bank president believes this is due to a lack of understanding of money markets and certificates of deposit.

LOCAL BANK is now offering customers with over $10,000 in savings the opportunity to put funds into a certificate of deposit and earn 5% interest annually with no fees. The minimum amount a customer needs to invest is $1,000, and the money must remain in the CD for at least one year.

The bank president wants customers to better understand CDs and not feel reluctant to take money out of savings to put into a CD. Your team must create an informational flyer to be mailed to all customers, placed at each bank teller station, and featured on LOCAL BANKâ€™s social media platforms.

You will present the information to the bank president (judge) in a role-play to take place in the presidentâ€™s office. The president will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas. During the meeting, the president will ask you two questions. After you have presented your analysis and answered the presidentâ€™s questions, the president will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.`
