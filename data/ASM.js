`EVENT SITUATION
You are to assume the role of the service center manager of SHINE MOTORS, an automobile dealership in a medium sized city. The dealership’s general manager (judge) wants you to determine how to reduce customer complaints within the service center’s courtesy shuttle program.

SHINE MOTORS, like most dealerships, offers courtesy shuttle service to service center customers. Once a vehicle is dropped off for service, the courtesy shuttle will transport the customer to a residence, place of work or other location within the city limits. The courtesy shuttle is also available to pick up customers once vehicle work is complete and transport them back to the dealership service center to pick up vehicles.

The service center receives complaints daily about the courtesy shuttle program. SHINE MOTORS only has one courtesy shuttle that seats five passengers. The passengers all have different drop-off locations, so some passengers remain on the shuttle for long periods of time before their destinations are reached. Customers requesting the courtesy shuttle for a return trip back to the dealership often have long wait periods before being picked up.

With no money in the budget to purchase an additional courtesy shuttle and too few vehicles on the lot to offer every service customer a loaner car, the general manager (judge) wants you to determine how SHINE MOTORS service department can reduce customer complaints with the courtesy shuttle program.

You will present your ideas to the general manager (judge) in a role-play to take place in the general manager’s (judge’s) office. The general manager (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear the information. After you have presented information and have answered the general manager’s (judge’s) questions, the general manager (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.`,

`EVENT SITUATION
You are to assume the role of the assistant manager of TIRE PALACE, a retailer that sells tires and wheels with four locations. The general manager (judge) wants you to outline a selling process for TIRE PALACE employees to assist with selling a new product.

TIRE PALACE is a trusted retailer in the large community. The business sells tires, rotates tires and provides free air pressure checks and service. While TIRE PALACE has a large clientele, most clients only need new tires once every six years. TIRE PALACE locations are not large enough to handle other automobile servicing, however the general manager (judge) has decided to add a new product to all four locations.  

Beginning next month, TIRE PALACE locations will begin selling and installing windshield wipers. The employees will be trained on how to determine which windshield wipers fit different vehicles, how to install and how to determine if new wipers are needed.  

The general manager (judge) wants you to create a selling process for employees to use in selling windshield wipers to TIRE PALACE customers.  

You will present your ideas to the general manager (judge) in a role-play to take place in the general manager’s (judge’s) office. The general manager (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear the information. After you have presented information and have answered the general manager’s (judge’s) questions, the general manager (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.`

Now generate a new scenario using this paragraph structure:

Performance Indicators: Place the performance indicators here, each on a new line. 

Paragraph 1: Setup  
Start with: “You are to assume the role of a [role] at [business]. The [judge] has asked you about [topic].” Briefly state the context of the roleplay, clearly identifying the student’s position, the company, and the main subject or challenge the judge wants addressed.

Paragraph 2: Judge & Company Context  
Explain what the business is, what they do, which customer demographic they target, and what type of automotive products, services, or customer programs they offer/market. Include any notable company reputation or unique characteristics relevant to the scenario.

Paragraph 3: Explanation of Program, Process, or Challenge  
Describe a specific company policy, program, operational process, new initiative, or challenge the business is facing. Clearly explain the current situation, any recent changes, or potential issues/opportunities. Reference the scenario range for inspiration and make the business need clear and relevant.

Paragraph 4: Imperative for the Student  
State what the student must do: recommend a solution, implement a plan, improve a process, or address a customer or business need. Make the expectation direct and action-oriented (“You must…” or “Your task is to…”).

Paragraph 5: Flow of Roleplay  
Describe where the roleplay takes place and how it unfolds, including two realistic, scenario-appropriate questions the judge will ask. Use the following required phrasing:  
"You will present the information to the [judge] in their office. The [judge] will begin the role-play by asking you about [main topic]. During your conversation, the [judge] will ask you two questions: [Question 1] and [Question 2]. The [judge] will thank you at the end of the meeting."

SCENARIO DEPTH:  
Each paragraph should have 2–4 full sentences, with meaningful, realistic details. Avoid dramatic emergencies or unrealistic executive actions. Student’s role and recommendations should be practical for a real-world mid-level manager.
