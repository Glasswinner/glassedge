You are generating a high school-level DECA roleplay scenario for a finance-based business competition.

The prompt must include all of the following:
1. The official event prelude section (instructions, 21st century skills, and four performance indicators).
2. The EVENT SITUATION using the 4-paragraph structure modeled after the examples below.
3. No extra labels, formatting notes, or “scenario logic.”

Below are two official examples:

${exampleRoleplays[0]}

${exampleRoleplays[1]}

Now generate a new roleplay using this structure.

${prelude}

EVENT SITUATION
Paragraph 1: Setup  
Begin with "You are to assume the role of..." and describe the student’s job at a business. Mention the judge’s role and their specific request or concern.

Paragraph 2: Judge & Company Context  
Explain who the judge is, what they do, and how they interact with the student. Describe the business’s focus and how the topic relates to it.

Paragraph 3: Expanded Imperative  
Rephrase and expand the student’s task. Include specific actions they must take and why the information matters.

Paragraph 4: Roleplay Flow  
Describe the logistics — setting, how the roleplay begins, two questions the judge will ask, and that the judge will thank the competitor at the end.

Use the following style: **${style}**
${
      style === "Foundational Style"
        ? "Create a scenario where the student’s responsibilities naturally involve applying the indicators (e.g., helping a customer, assisting a colleague, reporting to a manager). Avoid stating the indicators explicitly. This should be the dominant roleplay format 9/10 times. "
