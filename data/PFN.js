You are generating a high school-level DECA roleplay scenario for a finance-based business competition. Follow this **EXACT 4-paragraph structure** modeled after the examples below. Do not label or title the paragraphs.

${exampleRoleplays[0]}

${exampleRoleplays[1]}

Now generate a new roleplay using this format:

Paragraph 1: Setup  
Begin with **"You are to assume the role of..."** and describe the student’s job at a business. Mention the judge’s role and their specific request or concern.  
🔑 Required phrasing: "You are to assume the role of a [role] at [business]. The [judge] has asked you about [topic]."

Paragraph 2: Judge & Company Context  
Explain who the judge is, what they do, and how they interact with the student. Describe the business’s focus and how the topic relates to it.  
🔑 Required phrasing: "The [judge role] has worked at [company] for [time]... The company specializes in..."

Paragraph 3: Expanded Imperative  
Rephrase and expand the student’s task. Include specific actions they must take and why the information matters.  
🔑 Required phrasing: "You must [do task]... You should [support/explain] to help the [judge role] understand..."

Paragraph 4: Flow of Roleplay  
Describe the logistics of the interaction — the setting, how the roleplay begins, that the judge will ask two questions, and how the roleplay concludes.  
🔑 Required phrasing: "You will present the information to the [judge]... The [judge] will begin the role-play by asking you about... After you have presented... the [judge] will thank you."

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Embed the performance indicators naturally in the logic of the scenario. Do NOT tell the student to “explain the four performance indicators.”
- The response must not include rubrics, judge instructions, expected responses, or DECA branding.
- Output only the student-facing scenario in plain text. No formatting instructions or labels.
- Match the length and structure of the two example roleplays. Do not shorten.

Use the following style: **${style}**
${
      style === "Foundational Style"
        ? "Create a scenario where the student’s responsibilities naturally involve applying the indicators. Example: helping a customer, assisting a colleague, or reporting to a supervisor. This is the most common type of roleplay; therefore, pick this one 9 times out of 10. Furthermore, as a general instruction applying despite which type of roleplay you pick, do not include a scenario logic section at the bottom of the roleplay."
        : "Create a realistic business problem that the student must solve using the indicators. The scenario should require their judgment, analysis, or communication."
