EVENT SITUATION

You are to assume the role of an accounting consultant meeting with a client (judge). You have been hired to analyze the client's (judge’s) new venture into the gaming industry and provide instruction on recording business transactions.

The client (judge) has developed an innovative mobile game called EcoQuest that promotes environmental awareness and sustainability practices. The game allows players to build and manage their own virtual eco-friendly cities, complete with renewable energy sources, recycling programs, and wildlife conservation projects. It operates on a freemium model, where the basic game is free to play, but players can purchase in-game items and upgrades using real money.

The client (judge) has no formal business or accounting background and needs your help getting started. The client (judge) has already launched the game, which has gained significant attention with 1,000 downloads in the first week and $2,000 in in-app purchases. The client (judge) invested $5,000 of their own money to develop and market the game and spent an additional $1,000 on server hosting and maintenance.

Your task is to meet with the client (judge) to discuss the business, including how to best record business transactions. You must:

• Explain the role of finance and accounting in business.
• Prepare a brief chart of accounts for the business and classify the accounts.
• Prepare journal entries for the three transactions that have already occurred.

You will present the information to the client (judge) in a role-play to take place in the client’s (judge’s) office. The client (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented the information and have answered the client’s (judge’s) questions, the client (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.

You must [list the core tasks—e.g., calculate, prepare, explain, analyze, recommend] related to [the accounting concept or scenario]. You should [support/explain/apply] your findings to help the [judge role] understand [the reasoning, importance, or impact].

Paragraph 5: Roleplay Flow  
You will present the information to the [manager/owner/client] (judge) in a role-play to take place in the [company/judge’s] office. The [judge role] will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented your analysis and answered the [judge role]’s questions, the [judge role] will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.
